We are very happy to announce that Yin Tat Lee (IFDS coPI) has earned a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering for his work on faster optimization algorithms that are fundamental to the theory and practice of computing and many other fields, from mathematics and statistics, to economics and operations research. Each year, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation bestows this prestigious recognition upon a small number of early-career scientists and engineers who are at the leading edge of their respective disciplines. Lee is among just 20 researchers nationwide — and one of only two in the Computer & Information Sciences category — to be chosen as members of the 2020 class of fellows.
